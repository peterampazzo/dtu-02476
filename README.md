# 02476 MLOps Project

### Overall goal of the project
The main goal of this project is to apply what we have learned in this course about MLOps to a simple machine/deep learning problem. We aim to make our whole pipeline as understandable and efficient as possible, using the tools we have been given - having good and clear structure and setup, adding comments to the code to make it easier to understand and so on. We will tackle an image classification problem and try to get as good results as possible, given our timeframe.

### What framework are you going to use
It was decided to use the [Kornia](https://github.com/kornia/kornia) framework as it was deemed the best suited for this project which involves image classification.

### How to you intend to include the framework into your project
The main purpose of the Kornia framework in this project is data augmentation. The goal is to obtain a larger dataset, adding transformed images to the dataset we have already. Specifically, the focus is on the augmentation, the color, and the enhance modules of Kornia as these will provide all the necessary functions to manipulate the images (i.e. rotating, scaling, normalizing, etc.).

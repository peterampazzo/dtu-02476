# 02476 MLOps Project

### Overall goal of the project

The goal of this project is to apply MLOps best practices and tools to a Deep learning project.

### What framework are you going to use
It was decided to use the Kornia framework as it is the best suited for this project which involves image classification.
[Kornia](https://github.com/kornia/kornia)

### How to you intend to include the framework into your project
The main purpose of the Kornia framework in this project is data augmentation. 
The goal is to obtain a larger dataset, adding transformed images. 
Specifically, the focus is on the augmentation, the color, and the enhance modules of Kornia as these will provide all the necessary functions to manipulate the images (i.e. rotating, scaling, normalizing, ...).

### What data are you going to run on

### What deep learning models do you expect to use
